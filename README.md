This repo can be readily imported in some hosting platform, such as glitch.com, to have a running server.
Then you can connect to the server (from the [diagram editor](https://amblafont.github.io/graph-editor/index.html)) with wss://address-of-the-server.

The server resets when the last users quits the session.

# Give it a try!

A test server is available on glitch.com if you want to give it a try.

## Steps to test 

1. Go to https://yade-server-test.glitch.me/ to wake up the server if necessary (indeed, glitch.com puts unused servers to sleep). If you get a simple page with `Upgrade Required`, it means that it is actually running.
2. Copy the following address: wss://yade-server-test.glitch.me
3. Open [the diagram editor](https://amblafont.github.io/graph-editor/index.html), click on "Connect to server" and paste the above address. 
4. Ask your friends to perform steps 2 and 3 so that they can join the session.

Enjoy! Beware that the server address is made public here, so anyone could easily connect and edit the current workspace.
